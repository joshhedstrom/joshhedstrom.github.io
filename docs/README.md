Thanks for stopping by! This is my personal website.

From my bio:

Hey! I'm Josh Hedstrom, and I'm a passionate problem solver and full stack developer. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, Node.js and Firebase, as well as Bootstrap and Materialize. 

I'm creative, energetic, logical, a hard worker, quick learner, and always curious. 

I currently live in St. Paul, Minnesota, with my wife and 12 month old daughter. When I'm not coding, I enjoy running, music, craft beer, and spending time with my family.
