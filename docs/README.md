Thanks for stopping by! This is my personal website.

From my bio:

I'm Josh Hedstrom, and I'm a passionate problem solver and full stack developer. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Sequelize and Firebase, as well as Bootstrap and Materialize.

Full Stack Web Development enables me to utilize my artistic and logical abilities to thoughtfully engineer precision applications that are efficient, intuitive, and maintainable. I'm a hard worker and a quick learner; I'm creative, energetic, logical and always curious. I am passionate about writing clean code that is easy to read and maintain.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy running, music, craft beer, and spending time with my family. I currently live in St. Paul, Minnesota with my wife and 1 year old daughter. We will be relocating to Albuquerque, New Mexico in August 2018.
