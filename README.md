Thanks for stopping by! This is my personal website.

From my bio:

I'm Josh Hedstrom, and I'm a passionate problem solver and full stack developer. I'm Josh Hedstrom, and I'm a passionate problem solver and full stack developer. I currently am working in Java 6 and Angular 6. I also have experience in Vanilla JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, as well as straight HTML and CSS. I've worked with both MongoDB and MySQL, as well as Bootstrap and Material-UI.

Full Stack Web Development enables me to utilize my artistic and logical abilities to thoughtfully engineer precision applications that are efficient, intuitive, and maintainable. I'm a hard worker and a quick learner; I'm creative, energetic, logical and always curious. I am passionate about writing clean code that is easy to read and maintain.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy running, music, craft beer, and spending time with my family. I currently live in St. Paul, Minnesota with my wife and 1 year old daughter. We will be relocating to Albuquerque, New Mexico in August 2018.
